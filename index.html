        <p>Hi and welcome to the Slayartworx Showcase. My name is Robert Jason Slay; my friends call me Jason.
          I have been creating and drawing since the age of five years old. I have developed my style of
          art over the years by learning from and watching great artists, and following thier progress and careers.
          I am embarking on my journey into hopefully becoming a recognizable name within the art community.
          So what better place to start than my own webpage and gallery, committed to my particular style and perfered genre.
          I want to thank everyone for visiting. Even if you never commision me or buy any of my work, I appreciate you all.
        </p>

    and smaller independent projects through out the years. Currently I am building up experience
